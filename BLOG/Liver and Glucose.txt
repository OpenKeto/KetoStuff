When levels of glucose (and consequently insulin) are high in the blood, 
the liver responds to the insulin by absorbing glucose. 
It packages the sugar into bundles called glycogen. 
These glucose granules fill up liver cells, so the liver is like a warehouse for excess glucose.

When glucose levels drop, insulin production falls, too. 
The shortage of insulin in the blood is the signal that the liver needs to liquidate its assets, 
sending its glucose stores back into the blood to keep the body well fed between meals and overnight.

The liver doles out stored glucose and has the singular ability to make glucose from scratch. 
This is a critical function that keeps people alive when food is scarce. 
In people with diabetes, however, the liver doesn't process and produce glucose normally, 
adding to the challenge of blood glucose control.

The liver can't directly detect blood glucose levels; it knows only what insulin tells it. 
So, if there is a shortage of insulin or if the liver doesn't notice the insulin that's there, 
the liver assumes that the body needs more glucose, even if blood glucose levels are already elevated. 

Processing the body's fat is a key job for the liver. 
Once the liver is full of glycogen, it starts turning the glucose it absorbs from the blood into fatty acids, 
for long-term storage as body fat.

All of this extra fat produced and stored by the liver can sometimes lead the liver itself to get fat. 
One theory blames fatty liver for the development of insulin resistance in the liver. 
An insulin-resistant liver ignores the hormone's signal to stop sending glucose to the blood.

When youâ€™re not eating, the liver supplies sugar by turning glycogen into glucose in a process called glycogenolysis.
